## Why These Technologies?

### Next.js & React

Next.js 15.1 with React 19 provides the latest features for modern web development:

- **Server Components**: Excellent performance and SEO benefits
- **App Router**: Modern file-based routing with nested layouts
- **Edge Runtime Support**: Global distribution with minimal latency
- **TypeScript Integration**: Built-in TypeScript support
- **Image Optimization**: Built-in image optimization
- **API Routes**: Serverless API endpoints
- **Incremental Static Regeneration**: Dynamic content with static performance

### Directus

Directus serves as the backend CMS and API platform with several advantages:

- **Headless Architecture**: API-first approach with flexible content models
- **Admin Panel**: No-code interface for content management
- **Extensibility**: Custom API endpoints, hooks, and data seed extensions
- **Authentication**: Built-in user and role management
- **GraphQL & REST**: Multiple API access options
- **Self-hostable**: Full control over your data and infrastructure

### Turborepo

Turborepo provides the monorepo structure with benefits like:

- **Optimized Builds**: Intelligent caching for faster builds
- **Parallel Execution**: Run tasks across packages in parallel
- **Dependency Management**: Simplified management of internal dependencies
- **Consistent Configuration**: Share configuration across packages

### Shadcn UI & Tailwind CSS

This UI approach offers flexibility and aesthetics:

- **Component Library**: Pre-built accessible components
- **Utility-first CSS**: Rapid styling without writing custom CSS
- **Customizable**: Full control over component implementation
- **No Runtime**: Components are copied into your project, not imported as a dependency
- **Themeable**: Easy dark mode and custom theming
- **Accessibility**: Built with accessibility in mind

### Docker & Docker Compose

Containerization provides consistency across environments:

- **Environment Consistency**: Same environment in development and production
- **Isolation**: Each service runs in its own container
- **Scalability**: Easy scaling of individual services
- **Configuration**: Environment variables for different deployment scenarios
- **Portability**: Run anywhere Docker is supported

### TypeScript

TypeScript provides type safety across the entire application:

- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time
- **Developer Experience**: Better tooling and autocompletion
- **Documentation**: Types serve as documentation
- **Scalability**: Easier maintenance for large codebases

### React Query

Data fetching and state management:

- **Caching**: Intelligent caching reduces API calls
- **Background Refresh**: Keep data fresh without affecting user experience
- **Error Handling**: Built-in error states
- **Pagination & Infinite Scrolling**: Built-in support
- **Prefetching**: Improve perceived performance
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Works well with Next.js

### NextAuth

Authentication solution:

- **Multiple Providers**: Social logins, email/password, etc.
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling
- **TypeScript Support**: Type-safe authentication
- **Directus Integration**: Custom provider for Directus authentication

## Performance Considerations

The tech stack is optimized for performance:

- **SSR/SSG**: Server-rendered and statically generated pages for optimal loading
- **Edge Runtime**: Deploy to edge locations for minimal latency
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic code splitting for smaller bundles
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic image optimization
- **Caching**: Multiple layers of caching (Browser, CDN, React Query, Redis)
- **Turborepo Caching**: Avoid redundant builds
- **Lazy Loading**: Load components and data only when needed

## Security Considerations

Security best practices are implemented:

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based auth
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions in Directus
- **Environment Variables**: Secure storage of sensitive information
- **HTTPS**: Encrypted communication
- **Content Security Policy**: Protection against XSS attacks
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks
- **Input Validation**: Zod schema validation

## Upgrading Dependencies

This monorepo template is designed to make dependency upgrades easier:

- **Turborepo Workspaces**: Update shared packages in one place
- **Package Versioning**: Consistent versioning across packages
- **Containerization**: Isolate environment-specific dependencies

For specific upgrade instructions, refer to the documentation of each technology.
