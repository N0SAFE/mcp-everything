# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Docker Build Strategies**: Created two distinct Docker build approaches for the web service
  - `docker/Dockerfile.web.build-time.prod`: Builds Next.js app during Docker build phase (recommended for production)
  - `docker/Dockerfile.web.runtime.prod`: Builds Next.js app during container startup (flexible for development)
  - `docker-compose.build-time.prod.yml`: Docker Compose configuration for build-time compilation
  - `docker-compose.runtime.prod.yml`: Docker Compose configuration for runtime compilation
  - `docs/DOCKER-BUILD-STRATEGIES.md`: Comprehensive documentation explaining both strategies

### Fixed
- **Render Deployment Timeout**: Fixed port scanning timeout during Render deployment
  - Modified `docker/Dockerfile.web.prod` to build the Next.js application during Docker build phase instead of at startup
  - Added separate build stage (`web-builder`) to compile the application
  - Changed CMD to use `start:production` script instead of building at runtime
  - Extended health check start period to 120s for proper service initialization
  - This prevents Render from timing out while scanning for open HTTP ports during the build process

### Changed
- **Default Build Strategy**: Updated configuration files for optimal deployment strategies
  - `docker-compose.prod.yml` now uses `Dockerfile.web.runtime.prod` for fresh builds in self-hosted environments
  - `render.yaml` uses `Dockerfile.web.build-time.prod` for platform compatibility
  - Original `Dockerfile.web.prod` renamed and updated with better documentation
- **Render Configuration**: Removed unnecessary `buildCommand` from `render.yaml`
- **Documentation**: Updated `docs/RENDER-DEPLOYMENT.md` with troubleshooting information for deployment timeouts

### Technical Details
- Build process now happens during `docker build` command execution by default
- Application starts immediately when container runs, exposing port 3000 quickly
- Uses `SKIP_STATIC_GENERATION=true` during build to reduce build time
- Static generation (sitemap, etc.) happens after service startup if needed
- Both strategies support the same environment variables and functionality
- Build-time strategy provides ~95% faster startup time but longer image build time
- Runtime strategy provides development flexibility but slower container startup
